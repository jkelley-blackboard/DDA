# Direct Data Access (DDA) SQL Repository

This repository provides helpful SQL scripts and resources for working with Blackboard’s Direct Data Access (DDA) service. DDA allows querying a **read-replica** of the Blackboard database—never the production database—enabling administrators and developers to extract, analyze, and report on institutional data safely.

## Contents

- **Custom SQL Scripts**: Query examples and utilities for common reporting needs.
- **Schema References**: Links to official schema documentation and downloads.
- **Community Resources**: Slack channels, other useful repositories, and external guides.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jkelley-blackboard/DDA.git
   ```
2. **Browse available SQL scripts**  
   Scripts will be added over time in this repository. Check back for new content!

## Usage

- Review the SQL scripts to find queries relevant to your reporting or data extraction needs.
- Customize scripts for your Blackboard environment.
- Always test queries in a development environment before running on production.
