## 📘 Overview

This repository contains helpful SQL scripts and resources for working with **Blackboard’s Direct Data Access (DDA)** service. DDA provides access to a read-replica of the Blackboard database—never the production database—allowing administrators and developers to safely extract, analyze, and report on institutional data.

> ⚠️ These scripts are shared as-is and may require adaptation for your institution’s schema or environment.
